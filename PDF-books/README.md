The files here have been "imposed" for printing, folding, gluing,
in order to make a book.

Print them duplexed, with "short-edge" binding. Then fold each page in half,
and stack the folded pages. With a vise, clamp, or other means, pack the pages tightly, and apply white glue (or even better, bookbinder's PVA glue) to the folded edges. After you let them dry, you can get clever with your binding.

Enjoy!
